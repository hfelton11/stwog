;Description
:This template is used to prevent a newline during text where it isn't good for readability.
;Syntax
:<code>{{t|nowrap|text that shouldn't be wrapped}}</code>

;Example
:<pre>{{nowrap|text that shouldn't be wrapped even tho it is a really really long line of text...  in fact it is sooo long that it should require its own special scroll-bar...}}</pre>
:gives
:{{nowrap|text that shouldn't be wrapped even tho it is a really really long line of text...  in fact it is sooo long that it should require its own special scroll-bar...}}

;Beware of text containing special characters, like <code>|</code> or <code>=</code>
;They might need special treatment.

;Alternate syntax to allow special-characters (but trims lead/trail-spaces)
:<pre>{{nowrap|text= a Named-parameter can use = signs, but still has trouble with pipe-chars. (|) ... }}</pre>
:gives
:{{nowrap|text= a Named-parameter can use = signs, but still has trouble with pipe-chars. (|) ... }}

;Beware - the alternate-syntax example here ended up having BOTH parameters...
: the unnamed-1-parameter (after the pipe) was ") ... " which prints FIRST...
: the named-text-parameter (up to the pipe) printed second which ends at "("...
: also, other unnamed-parameters are ignored to highlight pipe-char issues...

;Error-text
:<pre>{{Nowrap}}</pre>
:gives
:{{Nowrap}}
