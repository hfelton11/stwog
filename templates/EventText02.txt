The storyline is split into {{#if:{{{1|}}}|{{{1}}}|?p1?}} missions and {{#if:{{{2|}}}|{{{2}}}|?p2?}} bonus missions.  These {{#if:{{{1|}}}|{{{1}}}+|}}{{#if:{{{2|}}}|{{{2}}}|}} missions are further described by:
* The storyline chart:
** Summarizes the storyline and each mission's prize amounts.
** For example, if there are 12-missions with 8-bonus-missions and each mission rewards 4 prizes; then the summary reads '''?/20 and ?/80'''.
* The enemies chart gives details (for each difficulty) of your opponents.
* The scoring charts (one chart per difficulty-level):
** Gives details of all the prizes (up to 4) that can be earned for each mission.
** The points earned can also activate more prizes described later.
